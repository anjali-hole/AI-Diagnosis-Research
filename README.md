# AI Research Repository
This repository contains all relevant files and scripts used for the AI-Assisted Diagnosis project titled "Evaluating LLMs for AI-Assisted Preliminary Medical Diagnosis: Accuracy, Risks, and Telehealth Integration". This project focuses on assessing the accuracy, safety, and potential integration of various large language models (LLMs) like Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI into telehealth platforms for preliminary medical diagnoses.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs in providing preliminary medical diagnoses based on case descriptions. The evaluation is done by comparing their responses against professional medical assessments, conducting risk analysis, and proposing strategies for safe integration into telehealth platforms.

## Project Structure

```
## Requirements

To run the code files, the following libraries are required:

```pandas```

```numpy```

```openai```

```requests```

Install them via:

```pip install pandas numpy openai requests```

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/anjali-hole/ai-research.git```

Navigate to the project directory:

```cd AI-Diagnosis-Research```

Install the required libraries:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

The scripts are organized to allow querying of various LLMs and saving their responses. 

Make sure to create a .env file in the root directory of the project to store your API keys. The file should have the following format:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
```

Replace your_openai_key, your_claude_key, and your_gemini_key with your actual API keys.

## Querying Models

Claude Model:

```python claude_diagnostic_query.py```

Gemini Model:

```python gemini_diagnostic_query.py```

OpenAI Model:

```python openai_diagnostic_query.py```

## Analysis

All model responses are saved in respective CSV files (llm_responses_claude.csv, llm_responses_gemini.csv, llm_responses_openai.csv) for further analysis. Consolidated analysis is stored in all_data_with_analysis.xlsx.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Files Explanation

```patient_cases.csv```: Contains the set of medical cases with descriptions, symptoms, and expected diagnoses for comparison.

```llm_responses_*.csv```: Files containing responses from the respective LLMs.

```all_data_with_analysis.xlsx```: Consolidated analysis of all models' performance, with statistical metrics and comparison tables.
